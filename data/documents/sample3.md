# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Cloud computing has transformed how businesses deploy and manage their IT infrastructure, providing scalable and flexible solutions.

## Cloud Service Models

The three main service models are:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Providing virtualized computing resources
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offering a platform for developing, running, and managing applications
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivering software applications over the internet

## Deployment Models

Cloud services can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Public Cloud**: Services offered by third-party providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. **Private Cloud**: Infrastructure used exclusively by a single organization
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds
4. **Multi-Cloud**: Using services from multiple cloud providers

## Key Benefits

Cloud computing offers numerous advantages:

- Cost efficiency through pay-as-you-go pricing
